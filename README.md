# Time Series Examples
This repository contains examples of time series analysis.

This repository contains nine files and two folders:

  1) `price_data` - A folder that holds stock prices in `.csv` files
  
  2) `supporting_data` - A folder that holds weather data in `.csv` files

  3) **gitignore** - Contains the files excluded from this repository

  4) **README.md** - This document

  5) **Time Series Stock Sample Data.ipynb** - A Jupyter Notebook containing examples of preparing time series data for analysis
  
  6) **Weather_data.ipynb** - A Jupyter Notebook containing a visualization of weather data
  
  7) **requirements.txt** - The requirements file for running the files of this repository
  
  8) **stationarity_check_funtion.py** - Contains a funtion that neatly displays the results of a Dickey-Fuller test
  
  9) **time_series.yml** - A file for replicating the environment required to run the files within this repository
  
  10) **time_series_removing_trends_and_decomposition.ipynb** - A Jupyter Notebook containing the removal of trends for time series analysis
  
  11) **trend_analysis.ipynb** - A Jupyter Notebook containing examples of stationarity
